* 0.4.0

- Add the global minor mode ~gpastel-mode~ (idea from Stefan
  Monnier). Use that instead of ~gpastel-start-listening~ which may
  soon be deprecated.
- Upgrade Emacs requirement to at least 24.4

* 0.3.0

- Make ~interprogram-paste-function~ an empty lambda instead of nil:
  It seems that some packages require this variable to reference a
  function.

* 0.2.0
