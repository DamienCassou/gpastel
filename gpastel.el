;;; Commentary:

;; GPaste is a clipboard management system.  The Emacs package gpastel
;; makes sure that every copied text in GPaste is also in the Emacs
;; kill-ring.

;; Emacs has built-in support for synchronizing the system clipboard
;; with the `kill-ring' (see, `interprogram-paste-function', and
;; `save-interprogram-paste-before-kill').  This support is not
;; optimal because it makes the `kill-ring' only contain the last text
;; of consecutive copied texts.  In other words, a user cannot copy
;; multiple pieces of text from an external application without going
;; back to Emacs in between.
;;
;; On the contrary, gpastel supports this scenario by hooking into the
;; GPaste clipboard manager.  This means that the `kill-ring' will
;; always contain everything the user copies in external applications,
;; not just the last piece of text.

;; Additionally, when using EXWM (the Emacs X Window Manager), gpastel
;; makes it possible for the user to use the `kill-ring' from external
;; applications.
